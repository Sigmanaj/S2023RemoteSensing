## Identifying Land Use Changes over time in Suburban Denver, CO Using Landsat8 Imagery


This is my work for my remote sensing class. This project contains the google earth engine code in python to run the work I have completed for my final project and one of the labs.

This project's goal is to compare the land cover classifications over time using NLCD data and classify landsat imagery by land cover classifications over time.

My final project's work was presented in a video powerpoint, and is located on youtube at https://youtu.be/9m2b34UcLHQ.
